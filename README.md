All tasks in lab-01 works the same way. Lines to start each task are commented, only thing is needed to uncomment exact task of various different.
Task 1 - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements, write the function that returns minimum of them.
Task 2. - You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements, write the function that returns average of them.
Task 3. You are given a number “n”, write the function for checking whether“n” is prime.
Task 4. You are given a number “n”, write the program using recursion for finding “n!”
Task 5. You are given a number “n”, write the function for finding n-th elements in Fibonacci sequence using recursion. (Fn = Fn-1+ Fn-2). F0= 0, F1 = 1.
Task 6. You are given numbers “a” and “n”, write the function that returns “an”.
Task 7. You are given a number “n” and an array of “n” elements, write the program that returns given array in reverse order without using array data structure.
Task 8. You are given a string “s”, write the function for checking whether “s” is all consists of digits.
Task 9. You are given numbers“n” and “k”,write the program that
k k k−1 k 0 n finds Cn(binomial coefficient) using formulaCn=Cn−1+Cn−1where Cn=Cn=1.
Task 10. You are given “a” and “b”, write the function for finding GCD(a, b) using recursion. (Hint: Euclidean Algorithm)
